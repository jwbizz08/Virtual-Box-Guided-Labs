# Virtual-Box-Guided-Labs

 Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring VirtualBox guided labs designed to enhance cybersecurity skills. These labs provide hands-on experience in setting up, configuring, and securing virtualized environments using VirtualBox. Through structured exercises, I explore various cybersecurity concepts such as network segmentation, malware analysis, penetration testing, and incident response simulations. Each lab includes detailed instructions, configurations, and tools used, allowing learners to develop practical skills in a controlled, virtual environment. Explore these repositories to see how I leverage VirtualBox to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and strengthen defense strategies effectively.
